People with Taurus Midheaven Leo Rising are social creatures of the zodiac gang. You attract others from all walks of life. Your openness, natural charisma, and optimism make you shine in social situations. However, you also turn heads with your unique sense of fashion. There’s a fiery passion behind your personality, making you the life of the party wherever you go. You are incredibly generous towards people you love and even strangers. As a natural-born leader, people often follow your advice, or you are seen as an authority figure at work.

## Good Taste

There’s an inherent desire to be noticed and stand out. You will likely have a one-of-a-kind wardrobe with hard-to-get pieces. As a person who enjoys being in the spotlight, one of the things you indulge in is your aesthetic or fashion. Enhancing your beauty is a must, and your self-care regime is unparalleled.

Although you splurge on your aesthetics, your spending is pretty moderate. You may enjoy budgeting and organizing your finances. Having financial security and structure is something that you take pride in.

## Secretive

Many people who know you consider you to be a private person. You like to keep the affairs of your home life separate from your public life. Maintaining a good image amongst strangers and peers is an essential skill you’ve learned from a young age. During your childhood, there may have been many secrets within your family.

Since Leo rules the heart, you are naturally generous. Although it is an admirable trait, you might be giving due to your thirst for acceptance and recognition. You want to be accepted amongst your friends, coworkers, and sometimes even strangers. You likely have an intense fear of rejection and humiliation: many times, your validation and worth stems from other’s opinions of you.

On the other hand, your Taurus Midheaven likes to find reassurance within itself. Instead of looking outward for confidence and self-love, Taurus knows they can generate it themselves. Additionally, Taurus manages finances well, so you’re not giving from an empty cup.

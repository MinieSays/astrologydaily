# Midheaven in Taurus: Abundance Galore

The sign Taurus is known for being simple, grounded, and sometimes a bit stubborn. With a Midheaven in Taurus in the birth chart, the person’s aspirations are affected by these traits. With a Midheaven in Taurus, you aim to create a strong foundation for yourself. Regardless of which profession you choose, you need tangible results. You have an innate desire to leave a footprint in this world that will last a lifetime.

## What is Midheaven?

The Midheaven is important as it tells us about soul aspirations and public reputation. It’s known as the MC and Medium Coeli (middle of the sky in Latin). It is a point in a natal chart that is at the chart’s peak and located in the tenth house of a natal chart. Think of it like the highest position in the sky at the time and birth location. As you age and develop your sense of self, the characteristics of the MC begin to shine through. To find your MC, you can use this [natal chart calculator](#).

### What the MC tells us about a person:
- **Goals & Career**: The MC provides indicators of a person’s occupation, desires, and what a person’s persona in the world.
- **Public image**: It hints at how people perceive you in a public or career setting.
- **Greatest aspirations**
- **A parental or authority figure**

It’s important to note that the sign of the MC isn’t going to define the career. For further knowledge of how this placement manifests, it’s advised that you look at the ruler of the house and any aspects connecting to the MC. You can find more about Taurus placements [here](#).

## MC in Taurus – Ruled By Venus

Since Taurus is ruled by Venus, it’s common for Midheaven in Taurus individuals to lean towards artsy careers; think actors, aestheticians, artists, musicians, or fields in creativity. But Venus loves beauty and luxury, so struggling for your career is outside your plan.

Unlike other MC’s, a challenge isn’t your desire, but the abundance and accumulation of riches is. Of course, Venus wants to enjoy all the luxuries in life.

There’s a natural talent for arts and aesthetics. If the career field doesn’t involve arts or beauty, you are more likely to be perceived as someone with a good fashion sense or taste.

Therefore, one of the primary objectives for a Midheaven in Taurus is to accumulate wealth. With this emphasis on materialism, you may appear superficial from an outsider’s perspective, but underneath the riches, your aim for money is for stability and practicality. You’re motivated by showing off your value to the world, and the best way to do that is through your job. The MC in Taurus pushes your desire to make a long-established public presence.

## Personal Life

Since Taurus enjoys the comfort of familiarity, they tend to reside in their hometown for their entire lives. You’re comfortable with your community. Your friends often spot you shopping at the same places time and time again.

You like to be perceived as dependable and calm in your community. Your friends know they can count on you when they need it. You’re usually the one people can count on to organize travel plans or events. People trust your sense of taste and organizational skills.

You appear level-headed in conversations to keep your public image untainted by unnecessary drama. You like to show your best side to the world and are perceived as a “people person.” A general appearance of being down-to-earth and uncomplicated attracts people to your energy. People feel like they can be themselves around you because you are so comfortable in your skin.

If this placement has aspects to planets in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh house, you may be a natural leader within your community.

You’re often stubborn and steadfast with your own goals. You may have had these goals since you were a child, and every step in your life is one forward to achieve those goals. A Taurus MC is not only hardworking but ambitious. You’re a long-term planner and value things that provide generational wealth.

## Professional Life

A Midheaven Taurus is a long-term visionary; they’re great at focusing on what’s down the road. Their hardworking abilities allow them to work steadily towards their goals. Although you’re a natural at your job, it’s important that your career is. What matters to you is a healthy work-life balance. You want a stable, low-stress job that allows you to tap into your creative side.

## IC in Scorpio

The IC (stands for Imum Coeli, aka the bottom of the sky) is the lowest part of the natal chart. It’s connected to the fourth house, representing home life and family matters. The IC can be connected to the environment you grew up in, your background, or the roots of your parents. Since the MC represents the public appearance, the IC represents what goes on underneath, the parts of our lives that we hide from the rest of the world.

The IC is where we came from, and the MC is where we strive to go. Since the innate desire of Midheaven In Taurus is stability, the IC can tell us how this aspect formed.

People with MC in Taurus might have lacked stability as a child. Fighting and stress might have been a normal home environment. Individuals may have experienced traumatic events during their childhood. Scorpio is ruled by water, so the trauma is often repressed. You might bury your traumas deep to be unconscious since the burden is too hard to bear. You realize that you need to take care of yourself at an early age, which usually means taking on too much or making adult decisions.

The obstacles you faced during the beginning years of your life may be why you’re working so hard for stability as an adult. You understand what it’s like to grow up with a lack, whether it’s financial insecurity or a place to sleep, and you might never want to feel that way again. You want to feel in control of your finances and career.

This placement can lead to being secretive about your personal life. There may be parts of your home life that you want to conceal from the public, such as a controlling person within the house or being the controlling one yourself. Having a Scorpio in the fourth house might manifest as having an intense childhood. On the brighter side, the Scorpio placement makes you resilient in almost any situation.
